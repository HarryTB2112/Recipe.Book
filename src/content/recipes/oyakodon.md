## Method

1. Combine the dashi, soy sauce, mirin and honey in a bowl and stir until the honey dissolves. This is the seasoning broth - taste it. It should be savoury, a little sweet, and deeply umami.

2. Add the sliced onions to a wide frying pan along with the broth mixture. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat and cook for 3–4 minutes until the onion softens.

3. Add the chicken pieces in a single layer over the onions. Simmer for 7 minutes, turning once halfway through, until the chicken is cooked through and the broth has reduced slightly.

4. Lightly beat the eggs - about 10–15 strokes, leaving some streaks of white and yolk visible. This gives the finished dish its characteristic marbled, silky texture rather than a uniform scramble.

5. Pour the beaten eggs evenly over the chicken. Reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid, and cook for 1–2 minutes until the egg is just set but still slightly soft in the centre. Remove from the heat while it still looks a little underdone.

6. Scoop steamed rice into bowls. Slide the chicken and egg directly over the rice, along with all the broth. Garnish with spring onions, basil and parsley.

## Notes

- Don't fully beat the eggs - the streaks of white and yolk create pockets of different textures as they cook, which is essential to the dish.
- The egg should be just barely set when you take it off the heat. Overcooked oyakodon is rubbery, undercooked is silky.
- Dashi powder (_hondashi_) is a perfectly good shortcut and is widely available in Asian grocery stores.

## Variations

- **Katsudon:** use the same broth and egg method, but replace the chicken with a breaded, fried pork cutlet (_tonkatsu_).

## Serving suggestions

A small bowl of miso soup alongside makes this a complete Japanese meal.
