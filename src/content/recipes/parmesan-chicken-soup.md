## Method

1. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, leek, carrot, celery and garlic. Cook for 6–7 minutes, until softened. Add the rosemary sprig.

2. Crumble in the stock cube and pour over the water. Stir to combine and bring to a gentle simmer.

3. Add the whole chicken breasts to the simmering broth - they should be fully submerged. Poach over low-medium heat for 15 minutes.

4. Remove the chicken breasts and set aside on a board. Remove and discard the rosemary sprig.

5. Mix the cornflour with 2 tbsp of cold water to make a smooth slurry. Pour into the simmering soup and stir constantly for 2 minutes until the broth thickens slightly to a light, silky consistency.

6. Add the cannellini and their liquid. Shred the chicken into large pieces using two forks and return to the pot along with the kale or spinach. Simmer for 2–3 minutes until the greens are wilted and the chicken is warmed through.

7. Remove from the heat. Stir in the grated Parmesan - it will melt into the broth. Taste and season generously with salt and black pepper.

## Notes

- Poaching rather than searing keeps the broth clean and light. This is a nourishing, restorative soup rather than a rich, heavy one.
- The cornflour slurry gives a gentle body to the broth without making it stodgy. Mix it with cold water first to prevent lumps.
- Kale holds its texture better than spinach if you're making ahead - spinach wilts and softens significantly.

## Variations

- **With pasta:** add 80g of small pasta (ditalini or orzo) in step 5, before the cornflour - simmer until cooked and skip the slurry.
- **With lemon:** a squeeze of lemon juice at the end lifts the whole soup.

## Serving suggestions

Serve with good crusty bread. A drizzle of extra virgin olive oil over each bowl is a welcome finishing touch.
