## Method

1. Heat the oven to 175°C fan (195°C conventional). Line **and** grease your baking trays — both steps matter here, as the sticky batter will cling to parchment alone. Use two trays so you can bake in batches without rushing.

2. Add the icing sugar, cocoa, salt and espressp powder into a large bowl and whisk briefly to combine.

3. Add the egg whites and vanilla extract. Stir with a spatula or wooden spoon until you have a thick, glossy, brownie-like batter. Don't over-mix — you're not whipping the whites, just combining everything until smooth and no dry patches remain. It will feel like there is not enough liquid to combine everything, but trust the process, there is.

4. Fold in the chocolate chips. The batter will be sticky — this is exactly right.

5. Scoop 2–3 tablespoons of batter per cookie onto the prepared trays, spacing them at least 5cm apart. They will spread significantly as they bake. A cookie scoop or two spoons both work well.

6. Bake for 8–10 minutes. They're ready when the tops are set and have formed a thin, papery crackle. They firm up as they cool.

7. Leave on the tray until cool before attempting to move them. They are fragile when warm and will tear if lifted too soon. Once cooled, they peel cleanly off the greased parchment.

## Notes

- The espresso powder doesn't make these taste of coffee — it amplifies the chocolate, making it taste more intensely of itself. Don't skip it.
- Egg whites at room temperature incorporate more easily. If you're using fridge-cold eggs, rest them in warm water for 5 minutes first.
- The batter can sit if you need to bake in batches. It will thicken slightly — just stir again before scooping.

## Variations

- **Sea salt top:** sprinkle flaky sea salt over each cookie just before baking for a salted brownie effect.
- **Nuts:** fold in 60g of roughly chopped toasted nuts with the chocolate chips.

## Serving suggestions

Best eaten the same day once cool — the crackle is at its most dramatic within a few hours of baking. After that, store in an airtight container. They stay fudgy for 2–3 days.
