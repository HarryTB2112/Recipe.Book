## Method

1. Place the chicken, bay leaves and a generous pinch of salt into a large pot. Pour over the stock — if it doesn't quite cover the chicken, top up with water. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce to a low simmer. Cook uncovered for 30-35 minutes, turning halfway through.

2. Remove the chicken and set aside to cool slightly, before shredding and adding back into the stock. Discard the bay leaves.

3. Bring the broth back to a simmer and add the rice and 600ml of water. Cook for 12 minutes until the rice is completely tender (it should be slightly overcooked).

4. In a bowl, add the eggs, the lemon juice and zest and whisk until fully combined. The mixture should look pale and slightly frothy.

5. To temper the eggs, ladle a spoonful of the hot broth into the egg-lemon mixture, whisking constantly.

6. Pour the tempered egg-lemon mixture into the pot in a slow, steady stream, stirring constantly. Stir for 2-3 minutes — the soup will thicken and turn beautifully creamy. **Do not let it boil** after adding the eggs, or the mixture will curdle.

7. Taste and adjust salt, pepper, and lemon juice. The flavour should be bright and tangy with a rich, savoury background.

8. Ladle into bowls and finish with a crack of black pepper and torn fresh dill or parsley.

## Notes

- **Tempering is everything.** The egg-lemon mixture must be brought up to temperature slowly before it hits the hot soup. Rushing this step is the only way to ruin this dish.
- **Don't re-boil the soup** once the eggs are in.
- Using bone-in thighs rather than breast gives a much more flavourful broth. The rendered collagen also helps the soup thicken.

## Variations

- **Orzo version:** swap rice for 80g orzo pasta - slightly different texture but equally traditional.
- **With greens:** stir in a large handful of baby spinach when adding the egg.

## Serving suggestions

Serve with crusty bread for dipping.
