## Method

1. **Air fry the potatoes.** Toss the cubed potatoes in a little oil and season with salt and pepper. Air fry at 180°C for 20–25 minutes, shaking halfway, until golden and crispy on the outside.

2. While the potatoes cook, heat the oil in a large pot or deep frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the pork mince and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned all over. Season with salt and pepper.

3. Add the diced onion and carrots. Stir together and cook until softened.

4. Add the curry blocks directly into the pot, break them up as you add them, distributing evenly. Stir constantly as they melt, coating everything in the paste.

5. Pour in the water gradually, stirring as you go. The sauce will come together into a smooth, glossy curry. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash more water.

6. Serve the curry with crispy potatoes. Drizzle with sauce and scatter over sesame seeds.

## Notes

- Curry blocks (S&B Golden Curry, House Vermont Curry) are available in Asian grocery stores and many large supermarkets. They are what define Japanese curry's distinctive flavour - don't substitute.
- The roux already contains salt, so taste before adding any extra.

## Variations

- **Traditional method:** skip the air fryer and simmer the potatoes in the curry sauce for 20 minutes until soft, for the classic Japanese home-cooking style.
- **Katsu topping:** serve with a breaded, fried chicken or pork cutlet (*katsu*) on top instead of, or alongside, the potatoes.

## Serving suggestions

*Fukujinzuke* (soy-pickled vegetables) or *rakkyo* (pickled shallots) are the traditional Japanese condiments alongside. Tonkatsu sauce and a drizzle of kewpie mayo are also excellent.
