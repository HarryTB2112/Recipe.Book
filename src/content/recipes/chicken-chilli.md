## Method

1. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions, carrots, celery, peppers and mushrooms along with a pinch of salt. Cook for 10 minutes, until everything is completely soft.

2. Add the tomato purée, chipotle paste, smoked paprika and oregano. Stir and cook for 2 minutes until the paste darkens and the spices bloom.

3. Pour in the passata, then fill the empty passata container about halfway with water and add that too. Crumble in the stock cube. Add the black beans along with all their liquid from the tin. Stir everything together.

4. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a steady simmer. Cook uncovered for 25–30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chilli has thickened and the flavours have deepened.

5. Add the shredded cooked chicken and stir through. Simmer for a further 5 minutes to warm the chicken through and let it absorb the sauce.

6. Remove from the heat. Melt in the dark chocolate and stir until dissolved. Add the grated cheddar and stir through until melted. Taste and adjust seasoning.

## Notes

- Using pre-cooked chicken is what makes this weeknight-friendly. The chicken doesn't need long in the pot - just enough to warm through.
- The dark chocolate is a classic chilli trick. You won't taste chocolate, it just smooths and deepens the sauce.
- The bean liquid (aquafaba) is flavourful and starchy - always add it rather than draining the tin.

## Variations

- **Beef version:** swap chicken for 500g beef mince, browning it in step 1 before adding the vegetables.
- **Extra heat:** add a finely chopped jalapeño with the vegetables, or a pinch of cayenne with the spices.

## Serving suggestions

Serve with rice, or with warm tortillas for scooping. Soured cream, pickled jalapeños and extra cheddar on the side. Guacamole if you're feeling generous.
