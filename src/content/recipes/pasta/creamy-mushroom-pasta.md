## Method

1. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to packet instructions until al dente. Before draining, scoop out a mugful of pasta cooking water.

2. Meanwhile, heat the butter and olive oil in a large, wide frying pan over high heat. Add the mushrooms in a single layer and leave them alone for 2–3 minutes until they start to colour. Toss and cook for another 2 minutes. Season well with salt and pepper.

3. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the garlic and thyme leaves and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly, until fragrant.

4. Pour in the white wine and let it bubble and reduce by half — about 2 minutes.

5. Add the cream and stir to combine. Simmer gently for 3–4 minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly.

6. Drain the pasta and add it directly to the mushroom sauce. Toss over medium heat, adding splashes of pasta water to loosen the sauce if needed. Stir in the Parmesan.

7. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve immediately in warm bowls, topped with extra Parmesan and a handful of fresh parsley.

## Notes

- Don't crowd the mushrooms — this causes steaming instead of browning. If your pan is small, cook in two batches.
- If you don't want to use wine, swap for a splash of vegetable stock or just use a little extra cream.
- Pasta water is liquid gold here — the starch helps emulsify the sauce.

## Variations

- **With pancetta:** fry 100g diced pancetta in the pan first, then set aside and add back at the end.
- **With truffle:** a few drops of truffle oil stirred in at the end takes this to another level.
- **Lighter version:** swap the double cream for crème fraîche and use less Parmesan.

## Serving suggestions

Serve with crusty bread for sauce-mopping duties and a simple green salad.
