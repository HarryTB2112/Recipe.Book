## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 170°C fan (190°C conventional).

2. Warm the golden syrup and marmalade together in a saucepan over low heat, stirring until combined and runny.

3. Remove from the heat. Stir in the breadcrumbs, lemon zest, orange zest, orange juice, cinnamon, ginger and salt. Leave to sit for 3 minutes to allow the breadcrumbs to absorb the syrup.

4. Beat in the eggs until fully incorporated.

5. Pour the filling into the premade pastry case and spread evenly.

6. Bake for 25–30 minutes until the filling is set and deep golden. The centre should have a slight wobble when you take it out - it will firm up as it cools.

## Notes

- Don't skip the 3-minute resting step - it lets the breadcrumbs swell and thicken the filling before the eggs go in.
- The marmalade adds a slight citrus bitterness that balances the sweetness of the syrup.

## Serving suggestions

Serve warm with clotted cream, custard, or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
