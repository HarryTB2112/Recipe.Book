## Method

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Cook the pasta until 1–2 minutes short of al dente - it will finish cooking in the sauce. Reserve some of the pasta cooking water before draining.

2. While the water heats, in a frying pan over medium-high heat, add the sausage meat. Break the meat down with a wooden spoon. Cook until the sausage is cooked through and browned in places.

3. Push the sausage to one side. Add the onion and garlic to the pan and cook until softened. Stir everything together. Add the rosemary and tomato paste, cook them out for a couple of minutes.

4. Add the mushrooms until soft, then add the kale until wilted.

5. Deglaze with white wine if you have any, or just a bit of water.

6. Add the chestnuts and stir to coat in the pan juices. Season with salt and pepper.

7. Add in the parmesan and cream cheese. Add some of the pasta water and stir together and bring to a bubble.

8. Add the drained pasta directly into the sauce. Toss vigorously for 1–2 minutes, adding more pasta water if needed.

9. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve immediately with extra Parmesan.

## Notes

- **Vacuum-packed chestnuts** are the easiest option here.
- Fennel seeds work well with pork sausage.
- Keep pasta water. You'll need more than you think.

## Variations

- **Bacon version:** replace sausages with 200g lardons for a smokier, more casual dish.
