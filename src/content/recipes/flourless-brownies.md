## Method

1. Heat the oven to 180°C fan (200°C conventional). Line a square baking dish (approximately 20x20cm / 8 inch) with baking parchment.

2. **Brown the butter.** Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Continue cooking, swirling occasionally, until the butter foams, then subsides, and the milk solids at the bottom turn golden brown. It should smell nutty and toasty - about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat immediately.

3. Mash the bananas thoroughly into the browned butter using a fork or potato masher until almost smooth. A few small lumps are fine. Add the maple syrup, vanilla extract and eggs. Stir until fully combined.

4. Add in the cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Stir until just incorporated - don't overmix. Fold in half the chocolate chips.

5. Pour the batter into the prepared tin and spread to the edges. Scatter the remaining chocolate chips over the top.

6. Bake for 20–25 minutes. The brownies are done when the top is set and a skewer comes out with just a few moist crumbs - not wet batter, but not clean either. They will continue to firm up as they cool.

7. Leave to cool completely in the tin before cutting into 9 squares. They are fragile when warm.

## Notes

- **The browned butter is what elevates this.** The nutty, caramel flavour from browning the butter transforms what could be a fairly plain banana brownie into something genuinely special. Don't skip this step or substitute melted butter.
- **Ripe bananas are essential** - they provide the sweetness and binding that makes this work without flour. Under-ripe bananas will give a starchy, less sweet result.

## Variations

- **Extra nutty:** fold in 50g of roughly chopped toasted nuts with the chocolate chips.
- **Espresso:** add 1 tsp instant espresso powder with the cocoa to deepen the chocolate flavour.

## Serving suggestions

Excellent warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
