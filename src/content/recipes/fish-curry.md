## Method

1. **Make the curry paste.** Add the garlic, ginger, red chillies, coriander bunch, onion, turmeric, cumin and 2–3 tbsp of water to a blender. Blitz to a smooth, green paste.

2. Place a wide pan over medium-high heat. Add the mustard seeds to a dry pan and toast until they begin to pop, 1–2 minutes. Add the butter and let it melt.

3. Add the curry paste to the pan. Fry for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the paste darkens slightly and smells deeply fragrant. This cooking-out step removes any raw onion edge.

4. Pour in the coconut milk. Stir to combine and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook for 5 minutes to let the sauce thicken slightly.

5. Add the fish pieces in a single layer. Poach over medium heat for 4 minutes, or until the fish is opaque and flakes easily when tested with a fork. Don't stir, just gently spoon sauce over the top.

6. Remove from the heat. Add the soy sauce, lemon juice and honey. Stir gently and taste, adjusting as needed.

7. Scatter over fresh coriander and serve immediately over rice.

## Notes

- The blended paste is the technique that makes this curry. It creates a more vibrant, cohesive sauce than cooking aromatics separately.
- For less heat, deseed the chillies before blending. For more, add an extra chilli or leave the seeds in.
- The soy, lemon, and honey finish is added off the heat to preserve its brightness.

## Variations

- **Prawn version:** replace fish with 500g raw king prawns - poach for 3 minutes only.

## Serving suggestions

Serve over basmati rice with warm naan bread.
