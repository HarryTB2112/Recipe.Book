## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 160°C fan (180°C conventional). Grease a baking tin (approximately 9 inches).

2. Add the softened butter and sugar to a large mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer, hand mixer, or a whisk and some effort until the mixture is pale.

3. Beat in the 270g of ginger preserve until fully incorporated. Add the eggs one at a time.

4. Add in the flour, ground ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and baking powder. Add the vanilla. Fold everything in with a spatula until you have a smooth, fully combined batter with no dry patches.

5. Spoon the batter into the prepared tin and level the surface with the back of a spoon or a spatula.

6. Mix together the 150g of ginger preserve and 3 tbsp of hot water to make the glaze. Spoon and spread it evenly over the surface of the batter.

7. Bake for 35 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean and the top is deep golden. Leave to cool slightly in the tin before slicing and serving.

## Notes

- **Ginger preserve** can be stem ginger in syrup (chopped).
- The glaze on top sets to a sticky, toffee-like layer. Don't thin it too much or it will disappear into the batter.

## Variations

- **With stem ginger pieces:** fold 3–4 balls of stem ginger (finely chopped) into the batter before baking for pockets of intense flavour.

## Serving suggestions

Serve warm, cut into generous squares. Exceptional with custard, or a scoop of good vanilla ice cream. Reheats beautifully in the microwave for 30 seconds - a perfect weeknight pudding.
