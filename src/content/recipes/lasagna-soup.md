## Method

1. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot, celery and mushrooms. Cook for 8–10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft.

2. Add the garlic and pork mince. Break up the mince with a wooden spoon and cook until browned all over. Season generously with salt, pepper and the dried oregano.

3. Add the tomato purée and stir for 1 minute until it darkens.

4. Pour in the chopped tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce and beef stock. Stir well, scraping up anything stuck to the bottom. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a steady simmer. Cook for 10 minutes.

5. Break the lasagna sheets by hand into rough 4–5cm pieces and add to the simmering soup. Stir and cook for 10 minutes until the pasta is tender. The soup will thicken considerably as the pasta starch releases into the broth.

6. Scatter over the grated mozzarella and Parmesan. Stir through gently and cook for a further 2 minutes until the cheese is melted and stringy. Taste and adjust seasoning.

7. Ladle into bowls and top with fresh basil.

## Notes

- The pasta will continue to absorb liquid as the soup sits, so leftovers will be thick. Add a splash of stock or water when reheating.
- Worcestershire sauce adds an important savoury depth - don't skip it.

## Variations

- **Beef version:** swap pork mince for beef mince, or use a mixture of both.
- **Extra veg:** a handful of spinach stirred in with the cheese adds colour and goodness.
- **Fresh mozarella:** tear fresh mozarella into the sauce while it is cooking for a more creamy soup.

## Serving suggestions

Serve with crusty bread for dipping. This is a full meal in a bowl.
