## Method

1. Place the whole oranges in a large saucepan and cover completely with water. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a steady simmer. Cook for **1 to 1.5 hours**, topping up with water if needed, until the oranges are completely soft and you can pierce them easily with a knife. Drain and leave to cool until you can handle them comfortably.

2. Heat the oven to 180°C fan (200°C conventional). Grease and line a 23cm (9 inch) round cake tin with baking parchment - base and sides.

3. Cut the cooled oranges in half and remove any pips. Add the orange halves to a food processor - skin, pith, and all. Blend until completely smooth.

4. Add the ground almonds, sugar, eggs and baking powder to the food processor. Blend again until you have a smooth, fairly liquid batter. Scrape down the sides and blend once more to make sure everything is fully incorporated.

5. Pour the batter into the prepared tin. Bake for **45–50 minutes**, until the top is deep golden and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. If the top is browning too quickly before the centre is set, cover loosely with foil.

6. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack. The cake will firm up as it cools.

## Notes

- **Don't rush the boiling.** The oranges must be completely soft throughout — the pith should offer no resistance. Under-boiled oranges give a bitter, tough result.
- This cake keeps exceptionally well. It actually improves after a day as the moisture from the orange distributes further through the crumb.

## Variations

- **With a syrup:** boil 50ml orange juice with 2 tbsp sugar until syrupy, then pour over the warm cake as soon as it comes out of the oven for extra gloss and intensity.
- **Lemon version:** substitute 4 large unwaxed lemons for the oranges. Reduce boiling time to 45 minutes as lemons are smaller.
- **With chocolate:** melt 100g dark chocolate and drizzle over the cooled cake, or fold 80g dark chocolate chips into the batter before baking.

## Serving suggestions

Serve at room temperature, dusted with icing sugar. Excellent with crème fraîche or thick Greek yoghurt. Also very good with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream while still slightly warm.
