          Welcome to <strong>Aimée's Recipe Book</strong> - a handpicked collection
          of recipes curated especially for the most wonderful person I know.
        </p>

        <p>
          This site is a gift for you. It is a place to gather all the dishes
          that we have made together, or separately, and made ordinary meals
          feel like proper occasions. Whether it's gluten-free cookies sticking
          to the tray, or a weeknight leek carbonara that tastes like it took
          all day - every recipe here is here because it belongs in a book with
          your name on it.
        </p>

        <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A clear ingredients list with quantities you can scale up or down
          </li>
          <li>All ingredients in metric (because we are normal)</li>
          <li>Step-by-step method written in plain English</li>
          <li>Notes, variations, and serving suggestions where helpful</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>A Note on the Recipes</h2>

        <p>
          Every recipe is tested, loved, and worthy of a weekend afternoon. New
          recipes are added whenever I see one I think you'd like - so bookmark
          this page and check back often.
        </p>

        <p>Love you. ♡</p>
